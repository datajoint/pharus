> :warning: The DJGUI project is still early in its life and the maintainers are currently actively developing with a priority of addressing first critical issues directly related to the deliveries of [Alpha](https://github.com/datajoint/DJ-GUI-API/milestone/1) and [Beta](https://github.com/datajoint/DJ-GUI-API/milestone/2) milestones. Please be advised that while working through our milestones, we may restructure/refactor the codebase without warning until we issue our [Official Release](https://github.com/datajoint/DJ-GUI-API/milestone/3) currently planned as `0.1.0` on `2021-03-31`.

# DJ-GUI-API Backend

Serves as the REST API backend for DJGUI project complimented by [React frontend](https://github.com/datajoint/DJ-GUI-React).
Built on top of `flask`, `datajoint`, and `pyjwt`.

Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/  )
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Run Locally

- Copy `local-docker-compose.yaml` to `docker-compose.yaml`. This file is untracked so feel free to modify as necessary.
- Check the first comment which will provide best instruction on how to start the service.

> :warning: The docker-compose file creates a docker network called `dj-gui-api` which is meant to connect the frontend to the backend via reverse proxy for development. Running or installation options currently being considered are [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Deployment options currently being considered are [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).

## Run Tests

- Create a `.env` as appropriate for your setup:
```shell
HOST_UID=1000 # Unix UID associated with non-root login
PY_VER=3.8    # Python version: 3.6|3.7|3.8
IMAGE=djtest  # Image type:     djbase|djtest|djlab|djlabhub
DISTRO=alpine # Distribution:   alpine|debian
AS_SCRIPT=
```
- Navigate to `LNX-docker-compose.yaml` and check first comment which will provide best instruction on how to start the service. Yes, the command is a bit long...
